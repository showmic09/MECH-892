# Debug Report
## List of the issues 
1. Incorrect File Extension in transfer_input_files:
   - transfer_input_files = p098_words,txt should be transfer_input_files = p098_words.txt
2. Unusually high memory request:
   - request_memory = 1TB is an unusually a large amount of memory for finding anagrams, which typically requires much less. This might be an error or an overestimation of the requirements
3. Inconsistency in File Names:
   - There is a mismatch between p098_words.txt used in arguments and p098_words,txt used in transfer_input_files
