I have first added a typo in the "transfer_input_files" lines.

Then when I ran the file I noticed the following error message:

15501146.0   niazche         7/11 21:19 Transfer input files failure at access point ap21 while sending files to the execution point. Details: reading from file /home/niazche/MECH-892/OSPool_workflow/lecture-7/troubleshooting/pp098_words.txt: (errno 2) No such file or directory


This PR closes #37.
